The Saveme is a 2D game inspired by the life of the prisoner. 
The prisoner tries to escape from the cage by handling the hindrances. 

The central ball is a prisoner we need to escape from the hindrances. The mobile screen is divided into two vertical areas :
*  Right side: To move ball rightward
*  Left side: To move ball leftward
