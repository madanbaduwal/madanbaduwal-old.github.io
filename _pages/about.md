Even I don't know who I am till now. But from western society of Nepal to getting scholarship at Tribhuvan University to being depressed and suicide attempt to being a machine learning engineer currently at Fusemachines, life has been amazing.

In this blog, I explain new things related to programming, mathematics, database, bigdata, datascience and  artificial intelligence.  

**Who I am?**  

I'm an engineer and researcher.
who break things at day and build at night.

**What I do?**  
I do research in the field of AI and apply it to solve the real life problems at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) . 

**Interest Areas**  
I'm interested in the research of any field related to artificial intelligence.

**How I am think?**

I am always thinking about the perspective of the human being because the human being is the smartest animal on the earth.

My life's ultimate goal is to try to create a copy of a human being that support human being to make human life better.

I start thinking from the top view of humans and create some analogy, 
* Brain: ALU(hardware) + machine learning(software). 
* Eyes: Camera(hardware) + brain(ALU(hardware) + machine learning(software))
* Mouth/Ear: Speaker/Receiver(hardware) + brain(ALU(hardware) + machine learning(software))
* Hand/Leg: robotics components + brain(ALU(hardware) + machine learning(software))

In the above analogy, we found that the brain is the most important part of human beings, that is why I am working on the analogy of the brain: Machine learning.

While iam working on that i never forget about Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Engineering.
