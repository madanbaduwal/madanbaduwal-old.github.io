<h1>Nathan Jacobs</h1>

<p>I am a computer vision researcher, but I also work on (deep) machine learning, remote sensing, and medical imaging. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at <a href="http://cse.wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, under the direction of <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/">Robert Pless</a>. If you are interested in discussing research, feel free to reach out via <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobsn">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jacobsn">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobsn/">LinkedIn</a>. You can also send me an email: my address is just the url of this site with the '.github.io' replaced by '@wustl.edu'.</p>

<p>I have a few different roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Professor, <a href="http://cse.wustl.edu/">Computer Science & Engineering</a> @ Washington University in St. Louis (starting Jul 2022)</li>
  <li>Director, <a href="https://mvrl.cse.wustl.edu/">Multimodal Vision Research Laboratory</a></li>
  <li>Professor, <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/">Computer Science</a> @ University of Kentucky (through Jun 2022)</li>
  <li>Director of Graduate Studies, <a href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/data-science">Data Science</a> @ University of Kentucky (through Jun 2022)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p> I am excited about using computer vision and machine learning techniques to understand the world. I have focused on a variety of problems, including time-lapse understanding, environmental monitoring, remote sensing, medical imaging, and video surveillance. You can learn more by visiting my <a href="https://mvrl.cse.wustl.edu">lab website</a> or checking out my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Nathan Jacobs earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis (2010). Since then, he has been a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Kentucky.  Dr. Jacobs' research area is computer vision; his specialty is developing learning-based algorithms and systems for processing large-scale image collections.  His current focus is on developing techniques for mining information about people and the natural world from geotagged imagery, including images from social networks, publicly available outdoor webcams, and satellites.  His research has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA, IARPA, NGA, ARL, AFRL, and Google.</p>
